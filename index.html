                <h3>About me</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>I have strong analytical and modeling skills, and I am capable of solving complex problems. Further, I enhanced those capabilities through my MSc degree in business administration at which I studied quantitative analysis in decision making. I have been very interested in optimization, MCDM, optimization-based computerized models, artificial intelligence, developing managerial information systems and decision support systems. One of my strongest assets that helped me in this field is my strong programming capabilities. I used to develop desktop applications, and I strengthened this talent through multiple training courses. I finished 90 hours training course in android applications development. Also, I finished 120 hours training courses titled “Microsoft Certified Solutions developer”. I know C++, Java, VB.net, C#, ASP.net MVC5 framework, and I am capable of coding complex functions or algorithms. Also, I possess outstanding skills developing and managing relational databases using SQL SERVER, and I am capable of writing long and complex SQL queries. Through my career at the ministry of agriculture as a project manager and IT expert, I have always employed my programming and modeling skills to develop my own creative tools to gain fast and efficient results with whatever tasks managed by me. Especially, coordinating NGO’s interventions and optimizing their effect, prioritizing agricultural sector needs, supporting high level decisions, and developing of computer systems. I also developed voluntarily a model for the ministry of works that determines priorities of war-damaged buildings reconstruction process. I worked with Oxfam at the household economy analysis project and developed a software that substantially shortened work time and returned way more accurate results.</p>

                    <h3>Master Thesis Abstract</h3>
                <div class="flow">
                    <p>
                        This study aims to develop a decision support system (DSS) to solve the multi-objective scheduling problem in universities that use credit hours. This system uses the new integrated zero-one goal programming (ZOGP) - analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approach.
                        The objective of this system is to build a semester study schedule that optimizes achievement of personal preferences considering their importance, capable of involving additional criteria. Moreover, the system simultaneously avoids breaching all registration restrictions defined, thus, the outcome is a schedule that is rapid, ready, and optimum with respect to the predefined goals and priorities.
                        The DSS is represented by a computer application that serves as a linear programming models generator. This application generates different multi-objective optimization models for different cases, solves them, translates the solution, and presents it in a readable format.
